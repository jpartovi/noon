# other ideas
# • - search_free_time – scan attendee calendars for the
#     earliest mutually available windows.
#   - propose_slots – generate a ranked shortlist
#     of candidate start/end times (with time‑zone
#     normalization).
#   - adjust_event – move an existing event by
#     ±N minutes/hours while keeping participant
#     constraints intact.
#   - sync_external – pull in events from external
#     sources (invites, shared calendars) and reconcile
#     duplicates.
#   - notify_attendees – draft/send updates or reminders
#     when an event is created, moved, or canceled.
#   - summarize_day – return a natural-language rundown
#     of the user’s schedule, conflicts, and gaps.
#   - set_preferences – store user defaults (meeting
#     lengths, working hours, buffer rules) for
#     downstream actions.
#   - resolve_conflict – pick which overlapping event
#     to keep, reschedule, or decline based on priority
#     rules.
#   - collect_requirements – gather missing metadata
#     (agenda, location, video link) before finalizing
#     an event.
